# ðŸŽµ Musical Instruments Classification

This project uses deep learning and computer vision to classify images of musical instruments. It supports multiple classes such as guitar, piano, drums, violin, trumpet, and more.

It can be used in:

- Educational tools for music learning  
- Automatic tagging of instrument images  
- Music-related mobile or web applications

## ðŸ§  Model

The classifier is built using a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on a labeled dataset of instrument images. You can either use the pre-trained model or train a new one from scratch.
